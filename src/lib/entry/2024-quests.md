In _The Comfort Crisis_, Michael Easter cited the concept of Misogi, challenges that push a person to their limit and engages them fully. The idea is that our hunter-gatherer ancestors were naturally exposed to harsh conditions and thus are constantly engaged with survival, whereas the same cannot be said for us.

The antidote is to create personal quests, to embark on Misogis, in both mental and physical realms which push us to our limits and fire up our senses and muscles. That resonated with me.

At work, I am responsible for planning roadmaps for product development in a fast-paced startup. But my own life is an unstructured mess. While I take pride in always finishing important tasks for the sprint, by hook or by crook, I am nowhere as accountable to myself. I take on hobbies only to drop them weeks later, with no concrete goals in sight. Meandering is not how I operate best.

And so, in this new year, I am going to approach life differently. There is no reason why my day-to-day cannot benefit from my affinity for challenges and knack for strategic planning, to create stretch goals for my personal life.

This site serves as an accountability tracker for my new take on life outside of work. Each Misogi is to be coupled with a clearly articulated _why_, and allocated no more than a quarter in time for completion. It starts with a couple paragraphs on motivations and work-ons, and concludes with learnings and a binary decision on whether I suceeded. The success or failure of each undertaking serves only as a goalpost to motivate action. No excuses will be made, but there is no room reserved for regret either.
